# ViewIt - YouTube Clone 🎥
## Source Code: https://github.com/your-username/ViewIt

A YouTube-inspired video-sharing platform that allows users to upload and stream videos seamlessly. ViewIt replicates key features of modern video platforms with a focus on UI/UX, performance, and scalability. Due to storage limitations, the live deployment is currently unavailable.

## 🚀 Features

- **Upload & Stream Videos**: Users can upload videos and stream them instantly.
- **User Profiles**: Each user has a personalized profile page (`@username`) displaying their uploads.
- **Dedicated Video Pages**: Clean video detail pages with dynamic routing (e.g., `/videoID`).
- **Smart UI Components**: Scrollable UI with auto-hiding scroll buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures a consistent experience across devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router DOM
- **Cloud Storage**: Cloudinary (for video file hosting)
- **Routing**: Dynamic routes like `/@username`, `/videoID`
- **State Management**: React Hooks

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. **Upload Video**:  
   - Navigate to the upload section.
   - Select a video to upload.
   - Video is stored on Cloudinary and linked to your profile.

2. **View Video**:  
   - Browse videos on the homepage or visit user profiles.
   - Click a video to open its dedicated video page.
   - Video plays using a responsive, embedded player.

3. **User Profile Routing**:  
   - Every user has a unique page (e.g., `@username`) showing all uploaded videos.
